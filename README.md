# Snake Game

This is the "Snake Game" project, created as part of the Day 20 project of the "100 Days of Python" course by Dr. Angela Yu.

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

The game is built using the turtle module in Python, which provides a simple graphics library for creating shapes and animations.


## How to Play

+ Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
+ Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., "snake_game.py").
+ Run the Python file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE).
+ The game window will open, and you will see a snake and food on the screen.
+ Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
+ Move the snake around the screen, trying to eat the food.
+ Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
+ The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
+ After the game ends, close the game window.
 

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python modules:

**turtle:** A built-in module in Python that provides a way to create graphics and shapes using turtle graphics.

## Acknowledgments

This project is a part of the "100 Days of Python" course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It demonstrates the use of the turtle module and provides a fun and interactive game for users to enjoy.

Note: The game's speed can be adjusted by changing the value passed to the ```time.sleep()``` function in the main loop.
